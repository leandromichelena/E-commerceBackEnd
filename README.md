Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 13. Starting from a working Express.js API, this challenge consists of configuring it to use Sequelize npm package to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
This application requires the user to have MySQL software installed on their computer to run. Install the node modules by running the usual commands `npm install` for the first time only. Then, the user should initialize MySQL and create the databases using the Schema file provided `source ~/.../db/schema.sql`. <br>
The starter code for this challenge included some seeds to be used for demonstration purposes. To add the seed data, after creating the database, please run `npm run seed`. You should get a few console messages stating that it was successfully included.

## Usage
This application doesn't include a front end interface. The Insomnia app was used for testing the routes during the development stage. <br>
